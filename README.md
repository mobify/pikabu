# Pikabu

## A speedy, flexible framework for off-canvas flyout panels.

<em>Simple markup</em> &mdash; Few containers and classes means
implementation is a breeze.

<em>Native scrolling</em> &mdash; Just like mom used to make. Momentum
scrolling in sidebars and smart fallbacks for browsers that don&rsquo;t support it.

<em>Customization</em> &mdash; No theme, just barebones HTML and CSS.
Pikabu is super customizable to your needs.

<em>Compatibility</em> &mdash; This thing works on everything.
We progressively enhance the experience for devices that support it.
